# vs-captcha
> This is a work in progress.

Do you hate captcha? Find regular captcha too boring? Looking for something competitive? [INSERT ANOTHER MADE UP LIFE ISSUE]?

Worry no more! VS-Captcha has you covered.

To pass the captcha, you must play a game against a random opponent. The game itself is random, the current only launch mode will be speed tic-tac-toe.

This is designed to be production-ready(although dont use it).
